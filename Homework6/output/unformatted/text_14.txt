Berserk Manga Slated to Resume on April 11


posted on 2014-03-10 23:56 EDT by Egan Loo












This year's sixth issue of Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine will announce on Friday that Kentarou Miura will resume the Berserk manga in the eighth issue on April 11.



Miura took a break to publish the Gigantomakhia mini-series.



Hakusensha published the 37th compiled book volume of Berserk in Japan last year. Dark Horse Comics published the same volume in North America in December. The manga inspired a new movie trilogy from Studio 4°C that Viz Media is releasing in North America.
