Berserk Manga's Main Storyline Resumes After 8 Months


posted on 2012-10-12 22:52 EDT by Jennifer Sherman












The main storyline of Kentarou Miura's dark fantasy manga Berserk resumed in this year's 20th issue of Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine on Friday. The storyline returned with a 24-page chapter after a hiatus of about eight months. A childhood story ran in this year's 12th through 14th issues, but the main storyline last ran in this year's 4th issue.



The manga's 37th compiled book volume is slated to ship in Japan on March 29, 2013. The limited edition of the volume will bundle an armored Guts figure.



The second installment of Studio 4°C's theatrical adaptation of the manga opened in theaters in Japan on June 23.
