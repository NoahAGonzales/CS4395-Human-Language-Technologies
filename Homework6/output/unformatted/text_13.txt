Berserk Manga to Resume After Miura Runs 6-Chapter Mini-Series


posted on 2013-11-03 03:00 EST by Egan Loo











Kentarou Miura's Giganto Maxia is set 100 million years in the future



This year's 22nd issue of Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine is announcing on Friday that Kentarou Miura will launch a brand-new original manga mini-series called Giganto Maxia. The six-chapter story is set in a world 100 million years in the future, and it will begin with a 44-page chapter with a color opening page. Young Animal adds that Miura's Berserk manga will resume after his new mini-series.



Hakusensha published the 37th compiled book volume of Berserk in Japan on March 29. Dark Horse Comics will publish the same volume in North America in December. The manga inspired a new movie trilogy from Studio 4°C that Viz Media is releasing in North America.

In its final volume, Crazy Food Truck hones in on a 'live fast, die young' approach that seems at odds with the mood of the previous volumes.
― If the ending to the second volume of Crazy Food Truck had you thinking it would lead into some lengthy, epic story arc that would carry the third volume to the foretold finish for the series, you'd end up surprised. We're still in the opening chapter of this...

              manga



There's enough potential that it may be worth a second volume, but this isn't likely to hold your interest unless you're deeply invested in the villainess isekai genre.
― Is it even possible to develop twists to the villainess isekai formula anymore? Probably, but the majority of series are more than content to tweak it rather than attempting to make something new. That's both perfectly okay and comp...

So far, Exoprimal has a fantastic foundation to work with. The game looks amazing, the matches are hectic and fun (if a bit long-winded), and there seems to be a good story on the horizon.
― Team-based hero shooters have to do a lot of work to get out from under Overwatch's massive shadow. Capcom is looking forward to establishing a contender with their upcoming Exoprimal, with a bonus: it's not just...
