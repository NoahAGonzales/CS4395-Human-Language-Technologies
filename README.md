Natural Language Processing Portfolio

## Overview of NLP
This pdf document describes an overview of natural language processing and also describes my personal interest in the topic.

The document can be found [here](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/18a6401e5b0cacc9d8d76f95f4aaa12601676591/Overview_of_NLP.pdf).

## Homework 1 - Text Processing with Python
This python program processes a csv data file by extracting and validating information about the persons in such.

### To run
Execute the following command in /Homework1:
> python Homework1_nag180001.py *path.csv*

Homework1_nag180001.py can be found [here](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/03f8d9fa7e4305c78397c615cd8d086383db9301/Homework1/Homework1_nag180001.py).

### Takeaway
Python is easy to use for text procesing. 
The many built-in functions and regex support make it easy to tokenize text.
However, the lack of built-in support for typing makes validating input more difficult - not that type support can't be added.

This assignment was a good refresher on python.
I had previously worked with python in other classes, such as AI and Software Engineering, but I do not frequently work with it outside of an academic setting.
Consequently, I knew the concepts for parsing strings and regex - pickle was new to me but not as involved.

## Homework 2 - Word Guess Game
This python program is a word guessing game that utilizes NLTK features to process text for the game.

### To run
Execute the following command in /Homework2:
> python Homework2_nag180001.py *path.txt*

Homework2_nag180001.py can be found [here](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/21e50defca4c63080bb6f54d82e7bb5567324c86/Homework2/Homework2_nag180001.py).


## Homework 3 - Wordnet
This is a notebook containing some play with WordNet.
The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/129340376f09cbc09028c70dad6e6191b16bf686/Homework3/HLT3_nag180001.ipynb)


## Homework 4 - N Gram Language Model
This assignment consists of 3 parts: a [python script](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/b73221efc7121e7ad271c3bd6b00f95a8a226477/Homework4/Homework4-1_nag180001.py) that writes dictionaries of unigrams and bigrams for each language (English, French, and Italian) to files, a [python script](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/b73221efc7121e7ad271c3bd6b00f95a8a226477/Homework4/Homework4-2_nag180001.py) that classifies a test file of text as one of those three languages and determines the accuracy of the classification, and a [paper](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/b73221efc7121e7ad271c3bd6b00f95a8a226477/Homework4/Homework4-3_nag180001.pdf) containing information on n-grams and their use.

### To run
To run the first script, which writes dictionaries of unigrams and bigrams to files, execute the following command in Homework4:
> python Homework4-1_nag180001.py


To run the second script, which classifies the test file as one of three languages, execute the following command in Homework4:
> python Homework4-2_nag180001.py
