## Overview of NLP
This pdf document describes an overview of natural language processing and also describes my personal interest in the topic.

The document can be found [here](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/18a6401e5b0cacc9d8d76f95f4aaa12601676591/Overview_of_NLP.pdf).

## Homework 1 - Text Processing with Python
This python program processes a csv data file by extracting and validating information about the persons in such.

### To run
Execute the following command:
> python Homework1_nag180001.py *path.csv*

Homework1_nag180001.py can be found [here](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/03f8d9fa7e4305c78397c615cd8d086383db9301/Homework1/Homework1_nag180001.py).

### Takeaway
Python is easy to use for text procesing. 
The many built-in functions and regex support make it easy to tokenize text.
However, the lack of built-in support for typing makes validating input more difficult - not that type support can't be added.

This assignment was a good refresher on python.
I had previously worked with python in other classes, such as AI and Software Engineering, but I do not frequently work with it outside of an academic setting.
Consequently, I knew the concepts for parsing strings and regex - pickle was new to me but not as involved.

## Homework 2 - Word Guess Game
This python program is a word guessing game that utilizes NLTK features to process text for the game.

### To run
Execute the following command:
> python Homework2_nag180001.py *path.txt*

Homework2_nag180001.py can be found [here](https://github.com/NoahAGonzales/CS4395-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/21e50defca4c63080bb6f54d82e7bb5567324c86/Homework2/Homework2_nag180001.py).
